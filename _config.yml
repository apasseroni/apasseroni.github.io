  I'm an experienced engineer who has been through all phases of the software development lifecycle, and I am used to being relied upon to come up with solutions to difficult problems when Google or Stack Overflow don't have an answer.

  In my professional experience I've used mostly <mark>C/C++</mark> and <mark>Java</mark>, but I'm also well-versed in <mark>C#</mark>. While I'm most comfortable working in any of those three languages, I've used a variety of others like <mark>HLSL/Cg</mark> and <mark>Lua</mark> in lesser capacities and I'm always open to opportunities to add new languages and tools to my skillset!

  In my free time I enjoy applying my skills to more creative projects like video game development. My tool of choice for these projects is the <mark>Unity3D</mark> engine, which I was first introduced to almost a decade ago and has been a great tool for me to hone my skills in game development and programming in general.
