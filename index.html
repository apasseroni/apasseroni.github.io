										<h2>Alex Passeroni</h2>

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>I'm a software engineer who has worked in the fields of defense and gaming since 2014. Regardless of the project, I'm passionate about developing user-centric applications and my unique blend of coding and design expertise enables me to do that effectively. I'm currently self-employed as I work on releasing my first game, <a href="#tilequest">TileQuest</a>, under my company <a href="#glhfstudios">GLHF Studios</a>.</p>
									<p>I live in Rhode Island with my partner and talented artist Sara and our retired racing dog Emma. When I'm not working, odds are you'll find me watching basketball, playing video games, enjoying a TV series or movie, or working through my never-ending list of home improvement projects.</p>

									<h3>My Expertise</h3>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="icon solid fa-code">
											<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
											<p>As an experienced software engineer, I take pride in writing clean, testable, and maintainable code. I'm most comfortable working in C#, C++, and Java, but I've also used a variety of other languages for smaller projects or tasks. Throughout my career I've been recognized by my peers and superiors for my ability to deliver quality solutions to difficult problems and troubleshoot esoteric defects.</p>
										</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-gamepad">
											<h4>Game Development</h4>
											<p>I've been tinkering in Unity for over ten years now, making prototypes for all sorts of game ideas and learning the ins and outs of the engine. However, in recent years I've been working towards transforming my game-making hobby into a profession. During this time I've honed my skills by learning to design gameplay loops and systems, implement gameplay systems and features, develop in-editor tooling to improve workflow and asset management, write shaders in HLSL and ShaderGraph, profile and optimize game performance, and more.</p>
										</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-bolt">
											<h4>Tools Development</h4>
											<p>I understand the advantages of creating and refining robust workflows and I enjoy developing tools to assist with or automate processes wherever possible. To this end, I've taken the initiative to develop tools for automated regression testing, build configuration and deployment, and software delivery. In the context of game development, I've developed tools to create and manage assets and content which makes for a more efficient workflow and allows me to design content more freely and creatively.</p>
										</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-users">
											<h4>Teamwork</h4>
											<p>Despite spending the most recent years of my career as a solo developer, I prefer working as part of a team. Throughout my career I've embraced the opportunities I've had to help onboard new team members, train junior developers, document and share my knowledge, and exchange thoughtful, unbiased, and constructive feedback with team members. As important as it is to me to be a high-quality engineer, it's equally important to me to be a high-quality teammate that others enjoy working with.</p>

												<h4>Raytheon Technologies</h4>
												<p>As a Senior Software Engineer on the U.S. Navy Zumwalt class destroyer program, I played a pivotal role in designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software for the most technologically advanced class of naval destroyers built to date. The work I did at Raytheon was split between two separate development teams within the same program, HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and ExComms (External Communications). My work on the former was predominantly developing user interfaces, while the latter was developing software to manage communication circuits and equipment.</p>

												<h4>GLHF Studios</h4>
												<p>I started GLHF Studios because I wanted to get back to what got me into software in the first place and pursue my passion for game development. The name stands for "good luck, have fun" which is how players traditionally greet each other in eSports games as a show of sportsmanship. I grew up playing competitive games like StarCraft, so it's an homage to my background in gaming and also represents my mission to create games with similar richness and depth. As a solo developer I have to wear all of the different hats required to make a fun and engaging game, and while that is challenging at times, it has been an invaluable experience that has pushed me to grow both creatively and technically.</p>

												<h4>TileQuest</h4>
												<p>TileQuest is the first game that I have developed under my company GLHF Studios. It's a tile-merging game akin to "<a href="http://play.threesgame.com/">Threes</a>" or "<a href="https://play2048.co/">2048</a>", but infused with elements commonly found in RPGs. Instead of numbers, tiles contain characters, items, and locations, which interact in interesting ways when they are merged or collide with each other. The goal is to take the familiar RPG gameplay loop of slaying monsters, looting items, completing quests, and leveling up heroes, and package it as a mobile-friendly puzzle/strategy game. The game is planned to be released in 2024.</p>

												<h4>Asteroid Miner</h4>
												<p>I developed this arcade style game for a week-long game jam where the goal was to reimagine the classic Atari arcade game, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ydu8UhIjeU&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming">Asteroids</a>" with some sort of twist. I chose to add a mining mechanic where the player has to deploy astronauts to mine resources from asteroids to increase their score. I've done a few game jams over the years, but this one is my favorite!</p>

												<h4>Threes Clone</h4>
												<p>This was an educational project that I made to go through the process of making a complete game. In order to remove any non-technical roadblocks, I chose to create a "clone" of the popular mobile game "<a href="http://play.threesgame.com/">Threes</a>" which I've always admired for its clever and minimalist design.</p>

In this game, players assemble robots from modular parts and watch them battle in a round-based elimination tournament. As an auto-battler, each robot is completely controlled by AI, with their behavior being influenced only by the parts they have equipped.</p>

												<h4>Third-Person Shooter Controller</h4>
												<p>This is an educational project I worked on with the goal of creating a robust character controller for a third-person shooter game. Going through this process taught me a lot about how to create a controller with finely tunable behavior as well as how to animate a 3D character. I mostly work in 2D and tend to use procedural animation in my occasional 3D projects, so this was my first time working with things like animation rigging, animation blend trees, and IK constraints, etc.</p>

												<h4>Low-Poly Environment Demo</h4>
												<p>The inspiration for this project was an idea I had for a 3D platformer/metroidvania game where the world is separated into zones that are each themed after a color in the spectrum of visible light. I created this low-poly environment as a sort of demo for what the blue zone in the game would look and feel like. While art is not my forte, I enjoyed the process of making this and it was a good way for me to learn the basics of 3D modeling, particle systems, shaders, and post-processing effects, with the most notable thing I learned being the use of LODs and batching to optimize the rendering performance of environmental assets.</p>
