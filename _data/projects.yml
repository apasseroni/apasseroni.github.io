    \"Threes!\" is a really fun puzzle game for mobile created by [Asher Vollmer](asherv.com/threes). It's a very well designed game with simple rules that make it easy to pick up and begin playing, but it also has a deceptively high skill ceiling.

    The idea is to swipe up/down/left/right to slide the numbered tiles around on the board, combining factors of three to create higher numbered tiles. The higher the number a tile has, the more points it's worth! Each time you make a move a new tile is added to the board, and the game ends when the board is full and you can't make any more moves.

    I recreated the game in the <mark>Unity3D</mark> as a fun project that exhibits some of my knowledge of the engine. If you want to try it out, you can play it [on the web](threes) or [download](download/ThreesClone.apk) it and install it on your <mark>Android</mark> device. If you like it, I highly recommend you try the original!
