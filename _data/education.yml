    The time I spent at URI was very valuable to me as it provided me with the foundation that's allowed me to be as successful as I have been to this point in my career.

    It was there that I learned the fundamentals of programming in object-oriented languages like <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>C#</mark>, and <mark>C++</mark>, how to logically break down problems and solve them algorithmically, and how to apply my theoretical knowledge as a computer scientist to the real world problems I am faced with as a software engineer.

    Most importantly I learned quite a bit about myself. I figured out the ways in which I work best, how I learn most effectively, and what it takes to be successful in a challenging and competitive field.
